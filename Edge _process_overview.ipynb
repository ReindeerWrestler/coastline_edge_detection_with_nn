    "# Help Installing opencv\n",
    "Installing opencv can be a major pain. There are some binary packages that you can install\n",
    "but one of the problems with those is that sometimes are unable to perform I/O or other\n",
    "important functions. So I'm including some resources to help you install opencv\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way that I found is to install __[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)__\n",
    "then use the following command in the terminal\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge opencv\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise the following are some good tutorials to install opencv \n",
    "__[pyimagesearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/19/pip-install-opencv/)__\n",
    "__[pydeeplearning](https://pydeeplearning.com/opencv/install-opencv-with-c-on-ubuntu-18-04/)__\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the easy way is what I recommend since install opencv is highly machine \n",
    "dependent so it is very easy to run into problems.\n",

    "# Wrap up\n",
    "I hope that this was enough for you to be able to have an overview of all of the edge \n",
    "detection methods that I have implemented. I know that the next stage of the project is\n",
    "to output the edge results of some of these processes to the band layers of the \n",
    "original tiff files. I recommend using ISODATA with Holistic as a testing backup.\n",
    "While possible including Canny Edge if you want to. Just find a way to set the \n",

    "\n",
    "The resulting band layers should be enough to allow you to construct vectors that you\n",
    "will need to began to actually track the coastlines over a time series, Good luck.\n"
